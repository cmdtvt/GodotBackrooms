# Godot backrooms project
this is basicly a long term project where i want to test godot's features.

things i want to add for now
- proper random world generation
- hiding from enemy
- running cables around the office to open a door
- each time door is opened and level is restarted the game is made harder.

currently i'm working on the world generation so it actually makes some sense.

scripts/python folder has some scripts for generating .json data for the world gen for now
